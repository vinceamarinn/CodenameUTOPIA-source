>IMPORTANT!!!!
- update area holder resource to use an on load event instead of an on load dialogue
- update dialogue module to support the new event calling functionality (alongside processing whether there's an [!event] flag in the line)

- actually make the events work LOLLLL


>GENERAL STUFF I SHOULD PROBS DO
- probably organize the assets folder a little better lmfao
- probably generalize the player overworld thing sprite loading or whatever to also work for everyone
- standardize kazuhito revealed into a story flags table! because individual flag variables are MORONIC (DONE)

>MUSIC
- add a new layer of chords to the final chorus of the investigation theme to make it truly feel final
- maybe some more ear candy in between chorus 1 and verse 2 with the panty & stocking riff part?
- record wahwah guitar for thinking time
- probably work on danger theme some more

>UI
- actually develop the add/removal systems
- pause menu with all the good stuff in it
- more ui elements like currently playing music

>SYSTEMS
- options menu
- title screen on game boot with debug quickstart
- loading screen minigames!!!
- implement trial system!!! (maybe its own module??? though i dont think thatd be super necessary)
- on-screen tutorial system

>CLUES SYSTEM
- add obtainable clues
- develop clue system to include photo, clue type and stuff like that
- finish clue inventory system

>CAMERA SYSTEM
- import & adapt camera functionality from old trial system
- add new camera stuff like following the player in overworld segments

>DIALOGUE SYSTEM
- flashback system
- dialogue logs (BASIC FUNCTIONALITY DONE, NEEDS CAP ADDED)
- auto scroll option HIGH PRIORITY
- port dialogue box handling to the UI module HIGH PRIORITY

>EVENTS SYSTEM (DONE)
- add a system to add events to interactables or dialogue (maybe even its own module maybe?), so that we can do things like show an image, start a flashback, etc
would probably work similarly to the interactable system, maybe the interactable system functionality could straight up all just be ported there LOL
