# Codename: UTOPIA - Source code
Hey there! Welcome to the official source code repository for **Codename: UTOPIA**!
This project was programmed entirely in the Godot 4 engine. 

## Downloading the source code & loading it into Godot
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to download the Godot project, for those who just want to look through it (for programmers, you should already know how to import a Github project into your workspace).

### 1) Download the source code as a .ZIP file
On the main page of repository, you should see a cool little green **'<> Code'** button. Hit the button, and at the bottom, you'll have two options:
- 'Open with Github Desktop'
- **'Download ZIP'**

That second button is the one you want to hit. Press it, and wait for Github to download the project onto your PC.

### 2) Import the Godot project
Unzip the file with WinRar, 7zip or whatever you use - and unzip the *'CodenameUTOPIA-source-main'* folder into the folder of your choosing, be it your default Godot project directory or just your Downloads folder because you couldn't be bothered to move it... no judging!

Regardless, you should now open Godot (make sure that it is at minimum the same version as the project - if in doubt, just make sure your Godot has the latest update). There, you can choose to either **Import** the folder directly, or **Scan** the directory it's in. Your call. Once that's done, you should now have the **Codename: UTOPIA** source code in your Godot's project list.

### 3) Open the project
Finally, just open the project. You'll have to wait a while for Godot to import in all the assets and load the environment and whatnot, but once that's done, congrats! You now have access to the **Codename: UTOPIA** source code! Have fun digging.
